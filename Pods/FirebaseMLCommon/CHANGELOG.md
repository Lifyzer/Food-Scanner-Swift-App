# 2020-05-19 -- v0.20.0
- Adds `getLatestModelFilePath(_:completion:)` API to `ModelManager` class for
  getting the absolute file path on the device for a downloaded custom remote
  model.

# 2019-10-08 -- v0.19.0
- **Breaking change:** Updates `ModelManager` with the following API changes:
  - Added `modelManager(app:)` for a custom Firebase app. Note that download
    management for custom Firebase apps is currently only supported for the
    Translate SDK.
  - Removed the `RemoteModel` and `LocalModel` registration APIs. You no
    longer need to register models before using them.
  - Added a model download conditions parameter in the
    `download(_:conditions)` API to make it easier to tie the conditions to
    specific download requests. You can fully control when to download a model
    for the first time and when to check for model updates via this API.
  - Updated `isRemoteModelDownloaded(_:)` to `isModelDownloaded(_:)`.
  - Added `deleteDownloadedModel(_:completion:)` to delete downloaded models to
    provide you with more flexibility for managing disk space on your user's
    devices.
- **Breaking change:** `RemoteModel` and `LocalModel` initializers have been
  disabled. New subclasses have been added for AutoML, Custom, and Translate
  SDKs. Use the intializers for those subclasses to create instances of remote
  and local models. `initialConditions` and `updateConditions` are no longer
  needed for initializing a remote model. Download condition should be specified
  each time calling `download(_:conditions:)` of the `ModelManager`.
